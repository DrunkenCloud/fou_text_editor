# Fou Text Editor

This project is th 2nd project from a series of projects recommended from the article https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html which I got from a primeagen video.

## How it works?

The base code as seen in fou.c is very much the kilo editor as in this article https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/ with just a few additional features.

Later using the concepts I learnt from this I made another editor trial.c (as in its name, I have completed it yet, I have features I want to implement but am lazy).

I used the piece table data structure to handle undo and redo operations over the simple kilo editor. This is a better alternative to use the straight up array method in kilo as the space complexity and time daly caused by allocating space would be too high.

# Thoughts

Overall this was a very fullfilling experience. My key takeaway would be implementing the data structure along with the interfact and memory management in C (man it was a ruthless teacher). I would recommend this project to others as well.
